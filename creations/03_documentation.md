# (c)Sound rendering

[Csound](http://www.csounds.com/) is extremely interesting. It is from 1984, and its paradigm  where you have to render the sound before hearing it, instead of real-time processing. This comes from constraints on computing power  But this lets us do some pretty incredible things, like

```bash
csound foo.orc bar.sco -o blah.wav
```

```python
#	SCORE FILE BREAKDOWN !!!
# 	-- first 3 parameters are ALWAYS the same! --
#	p1 = # instrument
#	p2 = start point
#	p3 = duration
```
