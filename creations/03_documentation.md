# (c)Sound rendering

Csound is extremely interesting. It is an old paradigm, where you have to render the sound before hearing it, instead of live processing.

```bash
csound foo.orc bar.sco -o blah.wav
```

```python
#	SCORE FILE BREAKDOWN !!!
# 	-- first 3 parameters are ALWAYS the same! --
#	p1 = # instrument
#	p2 = start point
#	p3 = duration
```

<audio src="03_seq002.wav" type="audio/wav"> </audio>
