## Old synthesizers

- [Buchla 100 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Electronic_Musical_Instruments#Buchla_100_series_(1960s))

- [RCA Mark II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Mark_II_Sound_Synthesizer): It used up a whole room.


#### Serialism
Parameters of music:

"sound" (not always true)
rhythm
tempo
patterns > cognitive load

scales
note - melody
frequency
pitch
timbre - envelope, resonance, filters
chords
polyphony
harmony,

harmony - rhythm - melody : pick only 2 to make complex, but the 3 of them would've been too complex for our cognitive load

**[Serialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism)** wants to rationalize all these parameters. You assign numbers to every note and construct a melody without repeating any of them. Then, with mathematical operations, you make shifts to the base melody and iterate.
**Integral serialism** also iterates on the rhythm.

> A style that will belong to humanity, to no nation. No one will go to war with this music

(same as [modern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement, i.e: [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier))

Started by **[Arnold Schoenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg)** with **[Anton Webern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Webern)** and **[Alban Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alban_Berg)** ([Second Viennese School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Viennese_School)). Other exponents: [Milton Babbit](Milton Babbitt)

plain chant, monks choirs > counterpoints
They only used a subset of 7 notes (only white keys) according to the [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)) (which were totally made up by Aristotle).

> Music was not something personal... You used to pray to it, have it on your wedding, hear at festivals

**Wagner**: had this idea that Western music was narrative, you could use it to tell stories. He was an *auteur*, and swapped the power in operas.
Also he was a racist, anti-semit, sexist asshole.

**[Ligeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti)**: He gave every 1st violinist a different sheet, making walls of sound with microtonal changes.

**[Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich)**: *[Piano phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Phase)* - two pianist playing the exact same loop but slightly out of phase.

**[Iannis Xenakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iannis_Xenakis)**: materialized sound, and what can we do with it how can we organize it to make it sound like music

**[Tony Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Conrad)**

**[Tristan Perich](http://www.tristanperich.com/)**: ITP Alum | *[Microtonal wall](http://www.tristanperich.com/#Artwork/Microtonal_Wall)* - 1500 small speakers playing one tone | *[1-bit music](http://www.tristanperich.com/#Album/1_Bit_Music)* - CD Case containing the simplest circuit to play music

> Music is making you feel something with data

We're gonna think about music as systems


**[Max Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews)**: Person accredited for the first Computer Generated sound. Person who the software is named after. Came from the Bell Labs

They came with a file format, "score": array of time | instrument | frequency
And another format, "orchestra": sine/envelope/amplitude
And all of this became a software called "music"

**[John Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Pierce)*

**[IRCAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCAM)** French research institute about music and sound

**[CCRMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_centers_and_institutes#Center_for_Computer_Research_in_Music_and_Acoustics)** Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, Stanford

#### Software
- **[CMIX](http://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html)**
- **[csounds](http://www.csounds.com/)**
  - we're going to use [Python](http://www.csounds.com/journal/issue14/realtimeCsoundPython.html) to write the csound code


#### An example
**["Star Wars and Modernism: An Artist Commentary"](https://hyperallergic.com/6504/star-wars-and-modernism/)**

**Style modeling** you take the melody, harmony, rhythm, etc from different places and mix them together
