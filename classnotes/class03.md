# Algorithmic Composition - Feb 07

## Musical Information

- frequency: sine wave > the number of oscillations per unit of time is a good way to know whether its higher or lower
	- pitch: culturally coded (middle C) > A = 440Hz (comes from a survey made on tons of european church organ), but can change!
	Before, everyone tuned to a base instrument, usually on the oboe
	MIDI speaks of pitches

	The only thing *humanity* concurs with, is that an octave is double the frequency

	- tuning: ways of

C -> C	: unison (tonic)
	-> C# : minor second
	-> D	:	major second
	-> D# : minor third
	-> E	: major third
	-> F  : perfect fourth
	-> F#	:	tritone
	-> G	:	perfect fifth
	-> G#	: minor sixth
	-> A	: major sixth
	-> A# : minor seventh
	-> B  : major seventh

in western music we usually use a SUBSET of the chromatic scale to construct something called a diatonic scale (called the key)

western music is also *triadic*

triadic | base | third | fifth
--------|------|-------|------
major   | 0    | 4     | 7
minor   | 0    | 3     | 7
aug     | 0    | 4     | 8
dim     | 0    | 3     | 6

*pythagorean comma*: pythagorean scale doesn't add up! There's a difference of 3.569427

*octave point pitch class*: middle C = 7.00 (octave 7 & note 0).
this means 7.12 = 8.00


Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata was an important piece. First one recorded to start with a harmonic context instead of a melodic context.

silver apples of the moon: first piece of music ever commissioned by a music label for electronic music - done on a buchla 100, which had a 16-step sequencer. This guy had three of these, and perform in a way that one went 16-step, 15-step and 13-step, so that the entire composition had to go 3120 steps before repeating.
